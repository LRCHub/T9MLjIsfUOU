You're on your way
They'll say you're radical
You wanna try
You need to grow
You need it more
Much more than anything
And now you dive
Into the ocean
You're going in
You're going in
You'll stand on the highest mountain
Maybe you'll drown again
You'll drown again
The road is long
They'll try to barricade
The path you're walking
Each single step you take
Up and away
Take heart they won't succeed
And when you stumble
Get back on your feet
You're going in
They know about nothing
You'll stand on the highest mountain
Maybe you'll drown again
You'll drown again
Up and away
Your're up in flames
Your heart is wild and free
Withstand the storm
And find your place to be
Don't you explain
They will not understand
And now it's time
To shake off your skin
You're going in
They know about nothing
You'll stand on the highest mountain
Maybe you'll drown again
You'll drown again
And now you're going in
They know about nothing
You'll stand on the highest mountain
Yes, you will drown again
But you'll rise again
Rise again
Yes, you will rise again
And now you stand on the highest mountain
